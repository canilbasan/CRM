Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis
This project focuses on customer segmentation for an e-commerce company using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis. The goal is to segment customers into different categories based on their purchase behavior and develop targeted marketing strategies for each segment.

Project Overview
In this project, we analyze a dataset of customer transactions and apply RFM metrics to segment customers. RFM segmentation is widely used in marketing to identify different types of customers, such as loyal customers, new customers, and those at risk of churning.

Steps in the Project:
Data Understanding: Loading and exploring the dataset to understand the data structure and identify any issues (e.g., missing values, returns).
Data Preparation: Cleaning the dataset by removing problematic entries (e.g., returns or missing values).
Calculation of RFM Metrics: Calculating Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics for each customer.
RFM Score Calculation: Assigning scores to customers based on their RFM values.
RFM Segmentation: Categorizing customers into different segments (e.g., "champions", "new_customers", "hibernating") based on their RFM scores.
Customer Segmentation Analysis: Analyzing the segments to understand the distribution and characteristics of each customer group.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from an e-commerce platform and contains transaction data from 2009-2010. The relevant features in the dataset include:

Customer ID: The identifier for each customer.
Invoice Date: The date of each transaction.
Quantity: The number of items bought.
Price: The price per item.
Description: The description of the item.
TotalPrice: The total cost for each transaction (Quantity * Price).
RFM Metrics
Recency (R): How recently a customer made a purchase. A lower recency score indicates that a customer has made a recent purchase.
Frequency (F): How often a customer makes a purchase. A higher frequency score indicates that the customer makes purchases more frequently.
Monetary (M): How much a customer spends. A higher monetary score indicates that a customer has spent more money.
Segmentation Strategy
Using RFM scores, customers are segmented into the following categories:

Champions: Loyal customers who make frequent, recent, and high-value purchases.
New Customers: Customers who have made their first purchase recently.
Hibernating: Customers who made only one or two purchases a long time ago.
At Risk: Customers who have made a few purchases but haven't bought recently.
Loyal Customers: Customers who make regular purchases.
Promising: Customers who are showing signs of loyalty.
Need Attention: Customers who need re-engagement.


Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language used.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Used for data visualization (if applicable).
Jupyter Notebook/VS Code: Development environment.
